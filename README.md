## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer with a focus on computer vision, leveraging PyTorch to build and train models that can interpret and understand visual data. This repository is a collection of my work in the fieldâ€”ranging from foundational experiments to more advanced projects involving deep learning architectures for image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more.

My primary tool of choice is PyTorch due to its flexibility, dynamic computation graph, and strong support for research and production workflows. I use it to design custom neural networks as well as to fine-tune and deploy pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet, and YOLO for solving a wide range of vision problems.

I work on projects that explore topics such as image augmentation, transfer learning, model optimization, and performance evaluation. Each solution is developed with attention to modularity, readability, and reproducibility. I also integrate data handling pipelines using tools like torchvision, OpenCV, and Albumentations to ensure robust input processing.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find well-documented notebooks and scripts that walk through model training, validation, and inference workflows. I include evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to provide clear insights into model performance.

My goal is to build computer vision systems that not only perform well in benchmarks but also offer practical value in real-world applications. From automating image analysis tasks to powering intelligent visual interfaces, Iâ€™m passionate about applying machine learning to create smarter visual technologies.

Feel free to explore the projects, test the models, or contribute. Whether youâ€™re working in research, engineering, or just exploring computer vision with PyTorch, Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and sharing knowledge within the machine learning community.
